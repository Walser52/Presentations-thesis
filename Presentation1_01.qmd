## Two Approaches in Material Design

::::{.columns}
::: {.column}
#### Edisonian

Trial and error strategy guided by intuition. 

Has dominated (still does) the identification of materials suitable for a specific application.


Edison tried thousands of different materials to find a suitable filament material for his incandescent light bulb.

:::
::: {.column }
#### Rational 

Data driven approach that tries to move the trial and error away from the lab.

Couple predictions from advanced computational screening with targeted experimental synthesis and validation.

Find building blocks that lead to properties to derive general design principles.

:::
::::

Tesla famously dismissed Edison's method as:

<blockquote>
...inefficient in the extreme...immense ground... to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened...a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 per cent of the labour.<sup>&#128481;</sup>
</blockquote>

# A Different Approach

Phenomenological models have their limitations. How do we get to the point where we know which materials to test?

Density Functional Theory (DFT) and cheminformatics allows us to ask more fundamental questions.

## Conductive MOFs


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"} 

Historically regarded as insulators.

Except design strategies exist that can make them conductive.

Applications: 

- Semi-conductive MOFs
- Electrocatalysis
- Chemiresistive sensing
- Ligand design
- and of course energy storage

#### Pathways

#### Questions
For use in energy storage materials conductivity is an important metric. We want to:

- Find how to pair metals and ligands so as to achieve high conductivity?
- Create a mechanism that finds these pairings fast?

# Summary {.scrollable}
The overarching objective was the evaluation of materials for energy storage. 

:::{.panel-tabset}
## I

The $\nu-\nu^{1/2}$ was providing (in many cases) classifications that were totally incorrect.

This misclassification results in wrong materials being selected.

The quadratic model provides a more accurate deconvolution of the charge storage contributions.

Atomistic calculations are needed however to ask deeper questions. Such as how does one find candidates for energy storage so that they may be synthesized in the lab.


## II

DFT calculations and cheminformatic analyses on MOFs help us identify design principles as they manifest themselves through trends in the data. For instance:

- Row 3 and 4 transition metals are more conductive (d-orbitals)
- Nd tends to outperform others
- The heavily tested Zn yields insulating behavior
- Smaller, non-aromatic linkers tend to perform better (at the expense of porosity)

## III

We do this in the hope that it would not only accelerate the discovery of new materials for energy storage but also ensure their accurate classification.

One possible future direction could be to zoom in on the opportunities identified and examine them more closely.
